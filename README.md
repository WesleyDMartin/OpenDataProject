# README

This project was created as an to attempt to quantify the impact of the LRT on the request and approval of new building permits in Kitchener and Waterloo. The site maps the total value of permits around exisiting LRT stations. It also provides a way to look in detail at the permits around each station.

This is a simple website I made, with the primary purpose of learning and practicing Ruby on Rails. As such, the implementation is fairly simple. 

* Make sure you have rails installed
* Clone the project and step into the folder
* Run `rails install` and `rails update` if necessary
* Start the server, `rails server`
